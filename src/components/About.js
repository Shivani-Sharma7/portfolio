      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>As a member of an intellectually successful family, my parents instilled in me the seed of ultimate knowledge and hard work, which is surely deeply rooted in me, and as a result, I have continued to perform well in my academics as well as in my professional career. Since I was a little child, modern technology like computers, phones, and other devices have piqued my interest. Surfing the internet, going to interactive websites, and learning about new technology have always sparked my attention.</p>

After all my comprehensive learnings and experiences at this point in my life, I aspire to produce something beneficial that can contribute to your organization.</p>
